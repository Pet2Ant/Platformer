# Platformer 
This was a game we were tasked to create for our Games and Media Development module. This is a 2D platformer game, which was created using the Godot game engine. 
## Storyline
In a world where circuits and gears define one’s worth, one robot dares to dream beyond the assembly line. Driven by an insatiable thirst for knowledge, our hero embarks on a quest for the ultimate recognition - a degree.  But this is no ordinary degree.  It’s a testament of skill, courage, and perseverance, only awarded to those who can conquer a series of formidable challenges. Join our robot protagonist as he adventures onwards, outwittting cunning adversaries, and defies all odds to prove that he’s more than just a machine.  Will he succeed and earn his place among the intellectual elite? Finish the game to learn how this robot's story ends. 
## Game Features
This game has three leves and a final boss, using a finate state machine for the bosses moveset.
The player may shoot at the enemies or the ground to propel themselves forwards or backwards ( depending on the angle of the shot).
The player has 3 hit points, but may pick up energy drinks giving them vitality as they go. Finally, there are power ups on the map in the form of cheat sheets that allow for the player to shoot faster.

## Contributions:
As this project was developed in collaboration with [Antonis Niotis](https://github.com/pet2ant/) and [George Konstantes](https://github.com/slendyraizex), work was split accordingly to each person's skillset. 
* I was in charge of designing the game's levels, such as how the tiles are placed on each map, where the enemies are, the spikes, power ups etc.
* Chris was in charge with creating the game physics, such as player movement, shooting, enemies, finite state machine for the final boss, pretty much everything involving something taking place in the game.
* Chris also assisted me with the creation of the level manager, meaning how each level interacts with the next or previous one.
* George was in charge of the graphical design of the game. He pretty much designed every single tileset, enemy and asset in the game.
